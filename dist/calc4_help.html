<p>This is the help and documentation for VMCalculator 4 from Centrum inc Software Solutions. It is a flash based calculator having a number of features and lacks a numer of capabilities that you expect from a calculator. Firstly this is a major breakthrough from our previous version in a lot of aspects. You would appreciate the amount of work that has gone into developing this software if you compare it with its predecessor. Through the development phase, we faced a lot of bugs and developed new algorithms for many operations and for optimising the code so that the application would run eficiently.</p>
<p>The last stage of development saw the addition of code for detecting keyboard strokes so that users  would be able to type the numbers and operations directly from the keyboard. It not only performs the basic arithmetic opns but at the same time trignometric and advenced computations. You can use it just like an ordinary calculator.</p>
<p>This is the first calculator in the world that displays the time. So thats a first from our Research Labs. </p>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<p>We have added a memory opn, but its effectiveness can't be trusted always. Some of the drawbacks that you may face while using this application colud be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flash always evaluates the number displayed. So '3.000' will  show up as '3' only. This is not a problem in this case but when you try to type something like 6.009, the zeros following 6 and decimal point are not displayed until you press 9. This might need some time to get used to.</li>
    <li>When you press an arithmetic opn button, the displayed number is cleared to 0 unlike other calculators which continue to display the first digit.</li>
    <li>When you try to find the log of a negative number, this app shows 0 instead of -E- in most other calculators.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>You can use the enter key instead of clear after completing an opn. eg: if you type 4 + 7 {Enter}, the result 11 is displayed and if you press {Enter} again, 0 is displayed or you have cleared the display! </p>
